                    <br><br>
                    After a site visit, we will assess the problem, the client will receive pictures of the job before we start, this will be sent to them via email 
                    or WhatsApp, you can also talk freely on the application anywhere in the world, The job will not start until the client gives the full go-ahead. 
                    Our mobile phones are on 24hrs a day 365 days of the year, our vans are fully loaded and can deal with any situation put in front of us.
